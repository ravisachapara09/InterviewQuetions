            question: 'Q4 - Explain any 2 modules of your choice <b> OR </b> Module Details',
            answer: ` ➢  I am excited about the <b>Leading, Managing and Development Talent module</b>. One of the fundamental aspects of running a business is Human Resource Management. Not only is it important to hire the right people, it is also essential to institute a training structure that would constantly adapt itself to the changing times. A constantly evolving workforce would contribute significantly to the success of the business. So I believe this module will immensely help me to develop a good team and lead and motivate them to increase the productivity of the organisation <br />
         <br />➢  I am also looking forward to the <b>Strategic leadership module</b>. It would be really amazing to be in actual corporate scenarios and try to devise solutions. Instead of completely following textbooks word by word, it is important to bring in your own creativity into it and I believe this module would help me for that. It willprepare me to think creatively and imply innovative strategies in the work environment. <br />
         <br />➢  I think I would find the <b>International Management of Finance module</b> challenging since I have not had much exposure in that field earlier. However I am very much interested in the module as I believe it would be beneficial for my future plans. Managing finance is especially important when any organisation reaches the expansion phase. So the contents of this module would play an important role as far as money management and financial decisions are concerned. <br />
         <br />➢  I am excited to learn <b>Organizational Resilience</b> in depth. It would be a challenging concept at the same time interesting to study how an organization should anticipate, prepare for, respond and adapt to incremental change and sudden disruptions in order to survive and prosper. I believe a person who is looking for a managerial role should be aware of this aspect. Because a responsible manager should be able to devise strategies anticipating such unexpected incidents. <br />
         <br />➢  <b>marketing strategy</b> refers to a business overall game plan for reaching prospective consumers and turning them into customers of their product or services marketing strategy covers the 4ps of marketing product price place and promotion <br />

This means as a student I will be gaining the right skills that any employer will be looking for. BNU has strong links with many industries, and thereby their courses are designed as per the industry norms.
         <br />•                  Class sizes are small and focused where students can interact amongst themselves and with the tutors for a well rounded understanding of the topics.
         <br />•                  BNU enables students to work on live projects from real clients thus getting a proper feel of the corporate environment.
         <br />•                  BNU is ranked Top 3 among the universities based in and around London for the Business related courses.
         <br />•                  BNU has invested £100 million in upgrading the facilities.

Their program known as the "Big Deal'' offers many exciting social interaction and cultural exchange activities. And I read from the University website that this one of the very universities that offer students all student union facilities for free. This will give me ample opportunities to enhance my extra curricular potentials.
         <br />•                  BNU also offers great flexibility in accommodation contracts and the rates have been reduced owing to the pandemic.
         <br />•                  As an international student, these are some important factors for me to choose BNU
         <br />•                  121st in the Times University Guide 2023
         <br />•                  77th in the Guardian University Guide 2022
         <br />•                  Buckinghamshire New University was ranked 12th in the UK by the Huffington Post in a list of creative universities and was also included in a list of the top 14 creative universities in the UK by The Daily Telegraph. In addition, BNU has won awards for its training of pilots and music industry management.
         <br />•                  Location of Bucks New University- Business related courses are delivered in the High Wycombe (pronunciation: High WIKUM) campus of the University. Central London is easily reached from the High Wycombe Campus by train or bus. It is just 40-45 min away from central London. Can reach London Heathrow international airport in 30-40 min via train. As an International student, the location of the University matters a lot as far as academic and internship opportunities are concerned.
         <br />•                  High Wycombe is a large market town situated in Buckinghamshire county. It lies in valley of the River Wye surrounded by the Chiltern Hills. It is famous for its furniture (Chair making) industry. The place is well connected with the nearby cities like Oxford, Reading etc.

            question: 'Q13 - Which other universities did you consider',
            answer: `I considered a few more universities which include University of Salford,<br />
        Teesside University, Solent University, and Greenwich University, De Montfort University (DMU) etc All these universities are offering MBA with placement year. The course fee was also very similar.<br />
        One of the major reasons to finalise BNU was the quick response from the University. The management was quite helpful in guiding me through the entire process and making my admission process hustle free.<br />
        Secondly, the course structure at BNU seemed to be very impressive. I found some unique modules like Organisational Resilience,Digital Leadership, Managing and Developing Talent etc quite attractive. So, A good and efficient manager or leaders must be able to develop the capabilities of the team members, nurture their careers, and manage the performance of individuals and teams. Simply put, leaders are responsible for developing the talent in an organization. So, I strongly believe that this course will make me a capable leader who can formulate and implement strategies for the growth of organisation and effectively manage challenges in a professional manner.<br />
        Another reason was the location of the university. Like Salford and Teesside are almost 3 hours away from London. It will take 1 and half – 2 hours to reach Solent and DMU from the City of London. Whereas BNU is very close to London but at the same time it is not in Inner London.<br />
        Greenwich is located in Inner London- this means I will have to spend more for my living expenses. Also I found that the student satisfaction rate of Greenwich for business related courses is 82% whereas BNU has 90%. These are the reasons why I chose BNU over the other universities.<br />
        <h5 style= {{backgroundColor : 'yellow'}}>ALTERNATIVE ANSWER</h5>
        <br />●            I have researched about other universities such as De Montfort University, University of East London, Derby University etc.. However the modules offered are quite traditonal like more emphasis on project managemnt, HR management, marketing, finance management. Whereas BNU offers a more balanced mix of traditional and contemporary and innovative modules like organisational resilience, digital leadership, developing talents in organisation, logistics and operations etc. I found the course content quite futuristic and impressive.
        <br />●            I checked University of Bath and University of Wales also. They offer similar programs but their location is quite far away from London. As as an international student I prefer to stay close to London and experience it in all its glory.
        <br />●            I also researched about Brunel University however the tuition was quite high- which was around 21,000 pounds. So I didnt proceed with that option.
        <h1>ALTERNATIVE ANSWER</h1>
        <br /> Yes I have researched two universities in uk that is Greenwich university in this university my course fee is
        <br />19.5k GBP which is high compare to BNU .

                <br />E.  UK’s offer really sophisticated admission and visa process for an international students.</div>
                <br />F.  In addition, UK had quality assurance agency which is an independent body that access universities and colleges regularly as per the quality of teaching and make sure that students get quality of education.</div>
                <br />
                <br />-> The UK is a multicultural country
                <br />-> As a student, I will get the opportunity to be taught by the world’s leading academics and experts. And last but not least the cost of education for an international student in the UK is generally lower compared to the USA, Australia and other countries
                <br />
                <br />1. <b>International students are welcomed</b> The UK has a long history of welcoming international students to study at its universities, and those who decide to study in the UK will be rubbing shoulders with some of the brightest minds from all corners of the globe. You will get the chance to mix, meet and interact with over 200,000 international students from all over the world, learning more about different walks of life in a place of contrasts and culture.

As a student you will get the opportunity to be taught by the world’s leading academics and to be creative and develop skills sets and confidence.
                <br />3. <b>Shorter courses</b> Most undergraduate courses in the UK take three years to complete, and shorter courses means a quicker graduation and less money spent on things such as tuition and living expenses. Two-year degrees are an increasingly popular option, whilst most Two-year degrees last just one year.
                <br />4. <b>The UK is an interesting place</b> to live With a mix of cosmopolitan cities and countryside villages, the UK is full of historical landmarks, famous music festivals, widely varied cuisine and amazing events to keep you entertained throughout the duration of your studies.
                <br />
                <br /> <b> Country comparison</b>
                <br /> Taking admission to the UK universities is relatively simple and renowned for higher academic standers.
                <br /><b>USA</b>
                <br />-> The coast of living and cost of education is very high. Like University of Florida provides masters of computer science with 29000$ tuition fees per yare. It’s a two year course
                <br />->  So it will be hard for me to pay my tuition fees.
                <br />->  In UK it takes only 1 year to complete master degree and fee at UEL is only 1500 GBP. So, it will help to reduce overall study cost and accommodation cost also
                <br /> <b>Why Not India</b>
                <br />- The Indian education system judge the students on the basis of their academic performance and not on the basis of their overall performance the focus is only on the theory subjects.
                <br />- The Student program in UK universities are well planned and designed to ensure that students gets the best learning. This system encourages creativity, develop multiple skills, builds confidence and enables students to think critically
                <br />- Now a days every employs wants people with a grip on English. And there is no better easy for a student to develop linguae skills than to learn them in the country of origin.
                <br />- This will help me to enhance employment possibilities in India
